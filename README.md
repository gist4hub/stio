# Star Trek viewing order for newcomers

There is no one true "in order", so this isn't the definitive answer, just a guide or an attempt to answer the question: "would would be a good viewing order for a newcomer?"

This answer tries to take into account maximising callbacks and references value and orderly introducing a new watcher into the Trek concepts that may be taken for granted as already known in later shows.

## TOS Era

+ <a id="tos">**01**</a> - _Star Trek_ ([TOS](#tos), the original series)
  - watch fully or skip fully or...
  - ...watch select episodes important for later shows:
    * `S01E11` _The Menagerie: Part I_
    * `S01E12` _The Menagerie: Part II_
    * `S01E14` _Balance of Terror_
    * `S01E22` _Space Seed_
    * `S01E26` _Errand of Mercy_
    * `S02E01` _Amok Time_
    * `S02E04` _Mirror, Mirror_
    * `S02E10` _Journey to Babel_
    * `S02E15` _The Trouble with Tribbles_
  - if skipping, maybe after you've seen all else, come back and watch everything at least once
  - year(s) of importance: **2266–2269**
+ <a id="tas">**02**</a> -  _The Animated Series_ ([TAS](#tas))
  - safe to skip, not of much consequence to the rest of the shows
  - watch if you like TOS or 70s style toons or are just a completionist
  - year(s) of importance: **2269–2270**
+ <a id="">**03**</a>  - Movies 1 through 6 with the [TOS](#tos) crew
  - <a id="tmp">1</a>  - _The Motion Picture_ ([TMP](#tmp)) is first, a bit in the style of _2001: A Space Odyssey_
  - <a id="twok">2</a> - _The Wrath of Khan_ ([TWOK](#twok)) is part 1 of a mini-trilogy
  - <a id="tsfs">3</a> - _The Search for Spock_ ([TSFS](#tsfs)) is part 2 of a mini-trilogy
  - <a id="tvh">4</a>  - _The Voyage Home_ ([TVH](#tvh)) is part 3 of a mini-trilogy
  - <a id="tff">5</a>  - _The Final Frontier_ ([TFF](#tff)) is usually considered the worst of them all
  - <a id="tuc">6</a>  - _The Undiscovered Country_ ([TUC](#tuc)) is the send off movie for that generation
  - year(s) of importance: **2273**, **2285-2287**, **2293**

## TNG Era

+ <a id="tng">**04**</a> -  _The Next Generation_ ([TNG](#tng))
  - although [TOS](#tos) is first, **[TNG](#tng) serves as the foundation for Trek**, so try to watch all of it once
  - many of the concepts and technologies and much of the world building is done in [TNG](#tng)
  - `S1` and `S2` might feel dated, but gets better from `S3`, watch to learn the main characters
  - if skipping `S1` and `S2`, watch some episodes for reference and/or because they're good:
    * `S01E01` _Encounter at Farpoint_
    * `S01E25` _The Neutral Zone_
    * `S02E09` _The Measure of a Man_
    * `S02E16` _Q Who_
  - year(s) of importance: **2364-2370**
+ <a id="gen">**05**</a> -  _Generations_ ([GEN](#gen)) is movie 7, the 1st with the [TNG](#tng) crew
  - has [TOS](#tos) characters cameo
  - is before [DS9](#ds9) `S4`, explains changes of main cast in that one
  - year(s) of importance: **2371**
+ <a id="fc">**06**</a> -  _First Contact_ ([FC](#fc)) is movie 8, the 2nd with the [TNG](#tng) crew

  - released between bottled episodes of [DS9](#ds9) `S05E07` _The Ascent_ and [DS9](#ds9) `S05E08` _Things Past_
  - has a minor reference to D`S9`, so you might want to watch it then, not much an issue if before
  - year(s) of importance: **2373**
+ <a id="ds9">**07**</a> -  _Deep Space 9_ ([DS9](#ds9))
  - `S1` and `S2` are before [VOY](#voy) and parallel to `S6` and `S7` of [TNG](#tng)
  - year(s) of importance: **2369-2375**
+ <a id="voy">**08**</a> -  _Voyager_ ([VOY](#voy))
  - the pilot starts with some plot threads from [TNG](#tng) and [DS9](#ds9) but [VOY](#voy) is mostly self-contained
  - first few seasons can be sub-par, but gets better from second half and near the end of `S3`
  - `S4` introduces a new main cast character that is also main in [PIC](#pic) later on
  - year(s) of importance: **2371 -2378**

+ <a id="nem">**10**</a> -  _Nemesis_ ([NEM](#nem)) is movie 10, the 4th with the [TNG](#tng) crew
  - after the [VOY](#voy) finale, but before anything of the Picard era ([LD](#ld), [PRO](#pro), [PIC](#pic))
  - continues with [PIC](#pic), one can go and watch that show now, then come back here
  - year(s) of importance: **2379**
+ <a id="ent">**11**</a> -  _Enterprise_ ([ENT](#ent))
  - prequel to pretty much everything
  - happens after [FC](#fc), so a character from it is referenced in `S01E01` _Broken Bow_
  - `S2E23` _Regeneration_ serves as a continuation of [FC](#fc)
  - `S4` references multiple episodes of mostly [TOS](#tos), but also [TWOK](#twok) and has a crossover [TNG](#tng) actor
  - year(s) of importance: **2151–2155**

  - many references to all of Trek shows before it
  - has a crossover with [SNW](#snw) `S02E07` _Those Old Scientists_, so best seen before [SNW](#snw)

  - year(s) of importance: **2380-2381**
+ <a id="pic">**14**</a> -  _Picard_ ([PIC](#pic))
  - can be seen before [LD](#ld) and should before [PRO](#pro)
  - `S1` continues themes from end of [TNG](#tng) and [VOY](#voy) plus [TNG](#tng) movies

+ <a id="pro">**15**</a> -  _Prodigy_ ([PRO](#pro))

  - has [VOY](#voy) cast appear in it, so after [VOY](#voy)
  - `S2` ends referencing a few things from [PIC](#pic), so after [PIC](#pic)
  - `S2` has a lot of callbacks to other Trek Shows as well, like [TOS](#tos), [TNG](#tng), [VOY](#voy), [LD](#ld)
  - year(s) of importance: **2383-2385**

## Era of Discovery

+ <a id="dis">**16**</a> -  _Discovery_ ([DIS](#dis))
