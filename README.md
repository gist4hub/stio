# Star Trek viewing order for newcomers

There is no one true "in order", so this isn't the definitive answer, just a guide or an attempt to answer the question: "would would be a good viewing order for a newcomer?"

This answer tries to take into account maximising callbacks and references value and orderly introducing a new watcher into the Trek concepts that may be taken for granted as already known in later shows.



## TOS Era 

+ **01** <a id="#tos"></a> - _Star Trek_ ([TOS](user-content-#tos), the original series)
  - watch fully or skip fully or...
  - ...watch select episodes important for later shows:
     * S01E11 _The Menagerie: Part I_
     * S01E12 _The Menagerie: Part II_
     * S01E14 _Balance of Terror_
     * S01E22 _Space Seed_
     * S01E26 _Errand of Mercy_
     * S02E01 _Amok Time_
     * S02E04 _Mirror, Mirror_
     * S02E10 _Journey to Babel_
     * S02E15 _The Trouble with Tribbles_
  - if skipping, maybe after you've seen all else, come back and watch everything at least once
  - year(s) of importance: **2266–2269**
+ **02**<a id="#tas"></a> -  _The Animated Series_ ([TAS](user-content-#tas))
  - safe to skip, not of much consequence to the rest of the shows
  - watch if you like TOS or 70s style toons or are just a completionist
  - year(s) of importance: **2269–2270**
+ **03** -  Movies 1 through 6 with the [TOS](user-content-#tos) crew
  - 1,<a id="#tmp"></a> _The Motion Picture_ ([TMP](user-content-#tmp)) is first, a bit in the style of _2001: A Space Odyssey_
  - 2,<a id="#twok"></a> _The Wrath of Khan_ ([TWOK](user-content-#twok)) is part 1 of a mini-trilogy
  - 3,<a id="#tsfs"></a> _The Search for Spock_ ([TSFS](user-content-#tsfs)) is part 2 of a mini-trilogy
  - 4,<a id="#tvh"></a> _The Voyage Home_ ([TVH](user-content-#tvh)) is part 3 of a mini-trilogy
  - 5,<a id="#tff"></a> _The Final Frontier_ ([TFF](user-content-#tff)) is usually considered the worst of them all
  - 6,<a id="#tuc"></a> _The Undiscovered Country_ ([TUC](user-content-#tuc)) is the send off movie for that generation
  - year(s) of importance: **2273**, **2285-2287**, **2293**

## TNG Era

+ **04**<a id="#tng"></a> -  _The Next Generation_ ([TNG](user-content-#tng))
  - although [TOS](user-content-#tos) is first, **[TNG](user-content-#tng) serves as the foundation for Trek**, so try to watch all of it once
  - many of the concepts and technologies and much of the world building is done in [TNG](user-content-#tng)
  - S1 and S2 might feel dated, but gets better from S3, watch to learn the main characters
  - if skipping S1 and S2, watch some episodes for reference and/or because they're good:
     * S01E01 _Encounter at Farpoint_
     * S01E25 _The Neutral Zone_
     * S02E09 _The Measure of a Man_
     * S02E16 _Q Who_
  - year(s) of importance: **2364-2370**
+ **05**<a id="#gen"></a> -  _Generations_ ([GEN](user-content-#gen)) is movie 7, the 1st with the [TNG](user-content-#tng) crew
  - has [TOS](user-content-#tos) characters cameo 
  - is before [DS9](user-content-#ds9) S4, explains changes of main cast in that one  
  - year(s) of importance: **2371**
+ **06**<a id="#fc"></a> -  _First Contact_ ([FC](user-content-#fc)) is movie 8, the 2nd with the [TNG](user-content-#tng) crew
  - before [VOY](user-content-#voy) S03E17 _Unity_, explains the redesign of the future "big bad" and cast changes
  - released between bottled episodes of [DS9](user-content-#ds9) S05E07 _The Ascent_ and [DS9](user-content-#ds9) S05E08 _Things Past_
  - has a minor reference to DS9, so you might want to watch it then, not much an issue if before
  - year(s) of importance: **2373**
+ **07**<a id="#ds9"></a> -  _Deep Space 9_ ([DS9](user-content-#ds9))
  - S1 and S2 are before [VOY](user-content-#voy) and parallel to S6 and S7 of [TNG](user-content-#tng)
  - year(s) of importance: **2369-2375**
+ **08**<a id="#voy"></a> -  _Voyager_ ([VOY](user-content-#voy))
  - the pilot starts with some plot threads from [TNG](user-content-#tng) and [DS9](user-content-#ds9) but [VOY](user-content-#voy) is mostly self-contained
  - first few seasons can be sub-par, but gets better from second half and near the end of S3

+ **10**<a id="#nem"></a> -  _Nemesis_ ([NEM](user-content-#nem)) is movie 10, the 4th with the [TNG](user-content-#tng) crew
  -  after the [VOY](user-content-#voy) finale, but before anything of the Picard era ([LD](user-content-#ld), [PRO](user-content-#pro), [PIC](user-content-#pic))
  -  continues with [PIC](user-content-#pic), one can go and watch that show now, then come back here
  - year(s) of importance: **2379**
+ **11**<a id="#ent"></a> -  _Enterprise_ ([ENT](user-content-#ent))
  - prequel to pretty much everything 
  - happens after [FC](user-content-#fc), so a character from it is referenced in S01E01 _Broken Bow_
  - S2E23 _Regeneration_ serves as a continuation of [FC](user-content-#fc)

  - <a id="#stid"></a>_Into Darkness_ ([STID](user-content-#stid)) is the second movie, a bit of a remake of original [TOS](user-content-#tos) story

  - has a crossover with [SNW](user-content-#snw) S02E07 _Those Old Scientists_, so best seen before [SNW](user-content-#snw)

  - S3 leans heavily on [TNG](user-content-#tng) final episodes and references [TNG](user-content-#tng) movies

  - year(s) of importance: **2399-2402**
+ **15**<a id="#pro"></a> -  _Prodigy_ ([PRO](user-content-#pro))
  - kind of parallel to [LD](user-content-#ld), can watch either before the other one, but LD comes before in the timeline
  - has [VOY](user-content-#voy) cast appear in it, so after [VOY](user-content-#voy)
  - S2 ends referencing a few things from [PIC](user-content-#pic), so after [PIC](user-content-#pic)
  - S2 has a lot of callbacks to other Trek Shows as well, like [TOS](user-content-#tos), [TNG](user-content-#tng), [VOY](user-content-#voy), [LD](user-content-#ld)

  - year(s) of importance: **2259**
